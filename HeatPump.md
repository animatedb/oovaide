<h2>Heat Pump</h2>
The solar system was installed in August of 2018 and we used local electrical
space heaters for the first two years. This is easy to see on the solar graphs
since the electrical use goes up a lot during the winter.

<h3>Selecting a Heat Pump</h3>
In September of 2020, we purchased a heat pump. A heat pump should be two or
three times more efficient than electrical heaters, especially in a mild climate.
Another advantage is that it can be used as an air conditioner, which we could
use for the few days a year when it is extremely hot.
<p/>
I looked around for quite a while looking at various types of heat pumps. There
are whole house heat pumps, but we mainly want to heat a smaller living space
much of the time. There are some called "Mini Split" heat pumps, but these
require a bit more work to install like putting some holes in walls, and possibly
working with refrigerant.
<p/>
I looked around a bit for whether to use a mini split system or some way of running
a vent. Every type of heat pump system needs some way to push air outside.
When heating, it sends cold air to the outside, and when cooling it will
output hot air.
<p/>
But then I realized we do have a fireplace that we never use with a cleanout
accessible to the outside.
This allowed us to settle on what is called a "portable" heat pump. These usually require
a window opening, but we didn't have one since they must normally be sliding style windows.
<p/>
The model is the Whynter ARC-14SH for about 540$ which works with a normal household
outlet. I was more concerned with heating, and it takes 10.5A or 1200W.
This model looked pretty efficient since it is 13000 BTU for heating and 14000 BTU
for air conditioning.
The hose diameter is about 6 inches.

<h3>Fireplace Cleanout</h3>
The fireplace cleanout inside the house looks like the following.
<br/>

The hole rectangular hole size is about 5 inches by 8 inches.
This is the size of a brick plus the mortar. I removed some mortar
with a hammer and chizel just to clean up the hole.

It is kind of hard to see in this picture, but below there is a cavity
to catch the coals before it can be unfilled from the outside.
I didn't do anything to it, so I am not sure what it does to the air flow.

<h3>Outside</h3>
The heat pump will be more efficient if it has an easy way to expel air.
The rectangular hole in the fireplace is about six by nine inches, so should
be large enough.
I made the outside vent cover very large so that it will not restrict anything.
The main idea is to keep animals from getting into the house and to
provide an easy access for air to get out of the house.
I made a ramp to improve the air flow.

This is the back of the vent. There is no back bottom brace to restrict
air flow.<br/>

I found an old screen, and used an angle grinder to cut it to size for some
old wood that had been outside and weathered a few years. A bit of primer
and another final coat and it looks fine. The screen turned out way
better than I expected. There is some elastic type rope to hold the screen
fabric in place in the aluminum, and it still was pliable and could be pushed
back into a new place after probably 50 years.<br/>

<h3>Inside</h3>
The hose should be as short as possible to prevent restriction of air.
The supplied extended hose is six feet. The metal part and hose connectors
were supplied with the unit. I took some old plastic packing material and fit
it into the metal piece to provide a bit more insulation and bug proofing.
It is just lying on the surface, but sits there pretty well. I put some small
pieces of wood screwed to the metal to keep it aligned over the rectangular
cleanout hole. The hole size pretty much exactly matches the hose connector
size of five inches, although it did not need to be this close at all.

So why do we need only one vent to the outdoors from the heat pump? The
heat pump can be set up where the input air is retrieved from inside the
house, and push the air to the outside. This is typically efficient if
the indoor temperature is close to the desired temperature and if it is
able to draw air from somewhere else in the house so that there is not a
vacuum. Our house is pretty well insulated, but the system seems to work fine.
<p/>
I put some foam sheet insulation into the chimney to prevent a bit more air flow.
I cut to size and could just stick it in place using friction.
Then for the fireplace cover, 
I took a piece of wood and glued foam insulation to it. This isolates
the inside of the fireplace from the rest of the house. I used Loctite
Power Grab that I had been around for a few years, but unopened. I am not
sure why I had it, but was surpised to see that it was fine.
