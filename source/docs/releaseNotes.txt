
Features
--------
	See the web site for a list of features.

Explanations
------------
	- In Windows, the proper version of libstdc++-6.dll must be used along
	  with gtk libs, etc.
	- If operations aren't shown for classes, use -x c++ for Clang.
	- If float.h is or intrinics are missing, make sure clang dir is under exec dir (bin).
	- If classes aren't showing relation to std::vector<>, use "-x c++" for Clang.
	- Analysis will run again if there are include path errors
	  (changing switches or files will rerun)
	- If editor doesn't go to many defs, make sure include paths are correct
	  for analysis.
	- NewNameDisplayStar name not shown in displayOtherThoughts sequence.
	  The typedef where the function is defined is shown.
	- Function body variables display const symbols by design.
	  See OovClassRelations.html.
	- If the error "undeclared identifier __builtin_ia32_bsrsi" displays,
	  this means that the clang headers are not found or the libclang.dll
	  version is different and not searching the same way. Windows libclang
	  3.6 allowed the clang library includes to be under bin, but 3.7 requires
	  ..\lib. The depends.exe shows that oovCppParser finds libclang.dll in bin
	  directory.
	- If the error, "Never use <adxintrin.h> directly", displays, the
	  Oovaide project must be set to exclude lib dir for analysis.
	- In mingw-5.3.0, cannot find libapi-ms-win-core-winrt-string-l1-1-0.a,
	  copying versions from 5.1.0 works.

Code/Design Guidelines
-----------
	- Error handling strategy - See OovError.h, OovStatus class.
	- OovCommon is a shared library between many components
	- OovGuiCommon is only used for GUI (GTK) components
	- Editing does not move breakpoints
	- No warning that debugging is not performed on currently built source code
	- In editor, F7 should build.

Missing Features
----------------
- Urgent
	- It looks like 3.7 is last version that is compiled without VS, so it works with gcc paths.
		pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-clang
			mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-clang 3.9.1-3
		-std=c++14
	- the linux .deb files do not install the example files.
	- use Wix to make a windows installer
	- need a better solution for VS/mingw - Msys has mingw libclang.dll, LLVM downloads has mingw version.
	- fix packages - isystem works better to hide warnings for package msys-mingw-w64
	- oovEdit:"unable to get screen size" when opening cstdio.
	- External Packages - Project Packages/ include can't have wildcard at end of path?
	- debugger needs running program console output - shows up in editor control window
	- editor undo doesn't scroll cursor into region
	- debug execution arrow doesn't clear sometimes
	- debugger doesn't have way to view reference values?
	- need better error messages for setting up debugger - should list menus in oovaide/oovedit?
	  If a build has never been done before debugging, need to describe how to build.
	- Support Python by using ## @param doxygen comments, members are on or before the line. @package
	  docstring = """do x and return list""", after method decl and after members self.attr
	  use filenames and directories as namespaces
- General
	- release win64
	- click on top left corner of oovaide program (settings menu) is terrible.
	- __chkstk_ms error for linking .so - make sure path is set to correct version of mingw.
	- Duplicate class/function names
	- Build Java/task sequencing
	- Preserve state between sessions
- Gui
	- Need to improve analysis/build settings for filters.
	- Add External Directories button for Build Arguments dialog.
	- Optimize directory path dependencies by oovBuilder, component diagram.
	  Store path dirs with indices to allow comparing indices?
	- Changing preferences should update drawings
	- For linux, don't getPackage if not in available list.

- Packages
	- BUG: doing File/New on an existing project doesn't delete package config.
	- BUG: Sometimes the Add Package dialog doesn't hide/close.
		- window might be busy and is not responding (oovCommon/PackagesProcess?)
	- Clean up package config if user reenters data.

	- Show unused classes - for visible drawing?
	- Show related classes for a selected class
	- Use genetic algorithm to optimize for shortest dependencies in each module

- Class Diagrams/List
	- cairo_text_extents varies for the same text depending on which class was
	  clicked to load the diagram from Simple example. Font is always Arial size 10.
	  Setting font size is interesting.
	- Find shortest path for two related classes with max depth of search
	- example names: member NotAStar typedef with base type int not shown
	  when drawing is loaded. Shouldn't show in add selected list?
	- Allow add all classes in module
	- Saved drawings don't save preferences for each class
	- BUG: forward class definitions mess up source line numbers
	- Show parameter reference/pointer/const in methods
	- find way to reduce strlen: std::allocator, std::less, std::basic_string<char> etc.
	  see ComponentBuilder
	- When class members are not shown, should be easy way to view members
	- Add go to operation (callbacks to journal)
	- Relation options should be per diagram.
	- reparenting preference options window messes up draw node options page.
	- Improve drawing, optimize graph for reduced line crosses
	- Add more diagram options (add depth=2, more generations)

	- Assert for call to constructor of base class (BackgroundQueueUnitTest)
	- Grid for placement, option for grid size
	- View source should go to selected function
	- Could provide go to class for member variables
	- Why does example Lamb class show MoveableThing?
	- Should show connections to this/super

- Sequence Diagrams
	- Find substring call from selected call with max depth of search
	- List of operations does selects multiple overloaded functions
	- Show class members in different color?
	- Don't discard current operation when switching between class and operation view
	- Allow restoring diagrams
	- Improve else/switch case
	- Show method parameters optionally
	- Find top level function in diagram, may not be first class.
	- View source only working on top level operation
	- Improve drawing of nested calls to same class
	- Diagram width not correct in svg diagrams for long operation names
	- Add depth
	- Add option to display parameters.
	- Option for not replicating operation definitions if already displayed.
	  New ... notation?
	- Calls through templates aren't displayed.
	- Allow rearranging class order?

- Build/Analysis Settings
	- Semicolons/CR must separate args when they are appended together?
	- Settings dialog isn't config specific for compiler and other tools
	- add cmakelists reader
	- add custom configs to build variable dialogs
	- tool paths should be specific to linux/windows - update when loading project?
	- source path in project is different on linux and windows.
		Need to change when opening project
	- Add help to describe dependencies on CLang, etc. Different for linux/windows
	- Add way to update compiler -isystem paths
	- Add -Wall, --analyzer
	- Add pthread to link if in compile switch? (external packages already does this)
	- Adding pthreads-stubs to analysis settings in linux hangs

- Analysis (builder and parser)
	- Java
	    https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3xos63/will_there_be_module_hell/
	    http://blog.codefx.org/java/dev/will-there-be-module-hell/
	    and wait for completion of previous jars (task flow scheduling, topological sorting)

		of-java-class-dependencies-for-a-main-class
	  - Variables in methods <BodyVarDecl> in xmi?
	  - code coverage
	- Duplicate class or function names, affects usage reports, drawings
	- Method usage: dup function names, con/destructors
	- Include usage: doesn't show usage of dup Java/C++ classes,
		external includes, or global functions (getCppArgs).
	- ZoneConnection is not listed as member usage of ZoneConnections::insertConnection
		- not in xmi file
		- CLangView shows:
			CompStmt, CallExpr "insert", UnexposedExpr, CallExpr "pair",
			TypeRef "ZoneConnection"
		visitFunctionAddStatements case CXCursor_CallExpr
	- Use clang_Location_isFromMainFile if it works for header source files.
	- Some header file changes don't reanalyze new dependent source files?
		(cause is due to errors don't get reanalyzed)
	- Duplicates info is not updated if some duplicate is removed. (hsh file not updated)
	- Missing MemberRefExpr for ClassGraph.UpdateNodeSizes, Saves .x instead of mPad.x

	- Multiple case statements without breaks appear nested.
	- Some statements not parsed: else (currently faked), goto, default, return, etc.
	- Save complete type info (explicit const, *, &, etc) in the XMI files?
	- Change class def/decl description in XMI file to find correct source module
		for empty classes.
	- Component specific build args not used to recalculate crc's for rebuild
	- Changing package does not cause reanalysis? (glib to gmodule)

- Build System (Build not required for displaying diagrams)
	- Should run post build custom job. (translate executable elf to intel hex)
	- isystem is in BuildArgsExtra-Analyze, but should be in BuildArgsBase.
		Options.cpp, extraCppDocArgs -> baseArgs
	- Improved build
	  - C++ modules (see clang, import, umbrella)
	    - order include dirs by component directory hierarchy
	    - module.modulemap - built automatically, but user can edit includes?
	    - create a new oovaide file in component dirs that defines what goes into modulemap
	  - solve dup filenames (ChibiOS, FreeRTOS, or RTEMS)
	  - provide custom hooks - doxygen, etc.
	  - two phases, 1. find dependencies, 2. build, trigger by editor,
	    what about dir moves?
	  - take ideas from ninja / build.gn / gyp
	    - gyp specifies target type, sources, dependencies, import files, compile flags
	  - read cmake files? or exec some of cmake to get packages?
	  - parent build files define settings for children
	- Java - use imports to build executable jars in correct order
	- Java - jar building needs to delete output jar.
	- Java - build failing in linux? Can't find *.class in makeJar()
	- Shouldn't have to  rebuild everything if project directories change
	- If Debug objects exist, but no analysis directory, Write file sharing error displays
		- Changing edit/preferences deletes analysis, but not debug/release
	- Build with relative paths doesn't include obj files (TestCpp)
	- Build of components within/under component directories not supported.
	- Scan CMake files to find external pkg-config package dependencies
	- The oovaide-incdeps file should be regenerated if the build settings change
	- Multithreaded build output is not synchronized well enough
	- Link only with project libraries that are needed for each component
	- A static lib without source should not be on link lines
	- BUG: Drive letters in path unable to write to bad filename.
	- Build sometimes must have objects specified before or after other libs/objects
	- split source of libraries into separate file for each function for release mode
	- Cross compiling: http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling
	- date compares should not be for older, but even if date changed
	  (in case of restore files)
	- Cache file times or monitor file changes

- CMaker
	- Change oovCMaker to generate target_include_directories instead of
	  include_directories. Change add_definitions to target_compile_definitions.
	- Use target_compile_features instead of -std=c++11
	- BUG: discards directories in CMaker::getCompSources
	- Allow debug/release and cross compile in cmake

	- Instead of coverage, change macro to log every instrumented line to
	  find crash sequence/threads.
	- fix switch/case fall throughs
	- fix precompiled header before include oovcoverage.h
	- filenames with underscore has stats, but not lines covered
	- space before semicolon under if with no braces? -
		Search ZoneDiagram.cpp "mZoom /= 1.5 ;"

- Editor
	- Support Unicode, copyright symbol, etc.
	- Editor does not get new project settings when they are updated in oovaide.
	- Editor should display on top if a module is selected in oovaide.
	- Hover over tab should display full file path in tooltip
		http://www.velvetcache.org/2007/08/22/gtk-tooltips-on-notebook-tab-labels
	- Syntax highlighting isn't updated for files dependent on a modified header.
	- Sometimes goto definition doesn't.  Second time works.
	- Click on tab should set focus to view so cursor displays
	- Make find in files a background task
	- Add option to prevent find in files for exclude directories.
	- Add history list of lines of last go to defs, go to method, etc.
	- context help window in linux doesn't go away
	- Restore previous session, save loaded files and line numbers when exit
	- On linux, the line number margin doesn't grow with more digits

	- unindenting doesn't work well when tabs are in file
	- display column/character position
	- refactor-rename

- Debugger (In editor)
	- Debugger path only works with forward slashes.
	- whatis for str var, std::++cxx11::string says incomplete type
	- Allow view variable by asking CLang for type to view (type)var
	- starting debugger too quickly can crash
		- find using coverage tool
		- set_terminate(handler)	void my_terminate_handler()

	- separate gui from backend - humble dialog
		- domain/presentation, business, backend, Business Logic Layer,
		  Domain Logic
	- redesign:
		which drawer when:drawers are defined in view, all other class
			functions have explicit references (no set drawer)
		initialize does not draw in non-view classes
		draw / queue draw (remove all drawing from business, only for size)
		remove cairo initialization from initialize functions.

	- remove dup journal code
	- remove dup graph code
	- Remove duplicate connections for getRelatedBodyVarClasses, etc.

- Closed
	- Goto class doesn't change tab to class tab - journal requires this
