This is a very cheap implementation of a code coverage tool for C++ that works pretty
well. It provides code coverage by instrumenting (modifying) the source code. It uses
some cheap parsing, so may not well for some source code. It generally looks for
open braces, conditional statements, case and default statements. The goal is very low
impact to the program under test with no modification of the logic of the program.

<h3>Download Python</h3>
<p/>
This requires Python. Pywin32 is the Microsoft COM support and requires a matched version of python.
This has been tested with Python 2.6.5 and pywin32-214.win32-py2.6.exe.
<ul>
<li>Download python from www.python.org/download/windows</li>
<li>Download Python for Windows Extensions from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p/>
The code coverage is performed in a few phases.
<ul>
<li>The code is instrumented and copied to another directory by running covInstr.py</li>
<li>The copied code is compiled</li>
<li>The code is run, and when the code finishes, will write an output file containing
hit counts for the instrumented lines</li>
<li>The statistics are displayed using covStats.py and the copied source code is
modified to contain hit counts for each instrumented line</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instrumentation</h3>
The covCommon.py source file has to be modified to target your source and output
project directories. The covInstr.py source file is used to instrument the source code.

<ul>
<li>Run IDLE.</li>
<li>Select File/Open to open the covInstr.py file.</li>
<li>Select Run/Run Module</li>
<li>Enter covInstr() in the "Python Shell" window and press Enter</li>
</ul>

For each line that is instrumented, a macro is inserted that increments a particular
value in an array.  The macro is contained in the header file "coverage.h", and the
values in the array have a particular data type with a certain number of bits, so the
hit counts may wrap. This file can be modified for a higher or lower value hit counts,
depending on the amount of memory available. The file can also be modified to prevent
wrap at the cost of speed for each instrumented line. The "coverage.h" file is generated
by the covInstr.py file.

<p/>
A proper C++ parser is not used, so there are many things that will not be instrumented
properly.  For example an open brace in a comment or string literal can cause indent
brace problems. An error will display for any file where the number of opening and closing braces
are not equal. A single statement with no braces after a conditional will not be instrumented if
the conditional spans multiple lines. An attempt is made to prevent instrumentation
of initialization of data in braces. For this to work properly, the brace or statememt must be on the
line after the keyword. For example
<table border="1">
<tr><td>Doesn't work</td><td>Works</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>class x {</pre></td>
	<td><pre>class x
	{</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td><pre>class x:
	public y
	{</pre></td>
	<td><pre>class x: public y
	{</pre></td></tr>
</table>

Lines that are inside of a #ifdef will also be instrumented, so this may lower the coverage
percentage.  To prevent lines in a certain ifdef from being instrumented, it is possible to
use "//" at the beginning of a line.

<h3>Execution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Copy non-instrumented source files necessary for the program under test</li>
<li>Copy build files to a location that will allow building the instrumented files</li>
<li>Add the coverage.cpp file to the build project for the program under test</li>
<li>Build the program under test</li>
<li>Run the program under test</li>
</ul>

On exit of the program under test, a destructor in the "coverage.cpp" file is run,
which writes the array containing all of the hit counts for the instrumented lines.
This file can also be modified in order to have different characteristics.

<h3>Statistics</h3>
The covStats.py source file is used to analyze the output from the program under test.

<ul>
<li>Run IDLE.</li>
<li>Select File/Open to open the covStats.py file</li>
<li>Select Run/Run Module</li>
<li>Enter covStats() in the "Python Shell" window and press Enter</li>
</ul>

Coverage statistics are displayed for each source file and all files, but they are the percent coverage
of instrumented code lines, which is not the same as percent coverage of total lines. It is
closer to the percentage of covered paths.
<p/>
An output file is generated for each file that shows the number of hits for each insrumented
line of code.  It is possible to find non-executed code by searching for "// 0"
<p/>
Since it is possible to read the instrumented code, it is possible to delete or comment
out problem instrumentation code, but no hits will be generated, so may lower the coverage percentage.
